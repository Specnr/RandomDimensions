# Random Dimensions

This is a datapack which compiles to generate completely random dimensions in vanilla Minecraft

## Prerequisites

This pack requires you to have Python 3.x installed on your device at compile time so you can run the scripts,
however nothing more than vanilla Minecraft is needed once the pack has been compiled

## Installation

- Download the latest release
- Run the run.py file
- Copy the contents of the `Compiled Datapacks` into your world datapack folder

## Known issues

- Traveling between dimensions is broken in Creative mode, since portal travel is instant
- Doesn't work with Paper servers for some reason, does work on default ones though
